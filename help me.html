<ul>
<li>The program is in its first public version. Its concept came to our mind while learning Python. This means that the program may contain some bugs and may not meet all the expectations.</li>
<li>We will constantly update the program to add new features requested by our users. This means that the more a feature is suggested, the quicker it will be implemented.</li>
<li>The program is only available in English at the moment. Support for translations will be implemented in future releases.</li>
<li>You can suggest features via GitHub if you are an English speaker, or contact us via Telegram through the Tech Window channel or through our own accounts. You can access ways to contact us through the help menu within the program.</li>
